vs-imwri
========
This is a now mostly obsolete image reader and writer based on the ImageMagick library. It works but you should consider other options.

Alternatives
------------
For reading images another source filter, for example [BestSource](https://github.com/vapoursynth/bestsource) is recommended. It's FFmpeg based and can handle most image formats as well.

Writing is a bit of a misfeature even and simply output using vspipe into FFmpeg or your favorite tool.

Note that the plugin still has a few niche uses and works. It just isn't being actively developed ever again.
